At our new international school, we have a clear goal: to provide a flexible, evidence-informed, and diverse curriculum that prepares our students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. We want our students to learn not only the facts and concepts, but also the skills and attitudes that will help them succeed in a rapidly changing world.

We understand that each student has their own unique context and needs, and that our curriculum should be adaptable and responsive to those needs. That is why we offer the flexibility to tailor our content to specific goals and priorities, while maintaining high standards of quality and coherence. By doing so, we aim to provide a curriculum that is relevant, engaging, and meaningful for our students and teachers.


To achieve this goal, we base our curriculum on the Ghana Education System content, and other international curriculums, as well as the latest research and best practices in education. We will incorporate the science of learning to ensure that our students develop deep understanding and effective strategies, to empower them for the future. We also prioritise cultural diversity in our curriculum, and we strive to create a learning environment where all students feel respected and valued. We do this by ensuring that our teaching staff reflects the diversity of our student body, and by selecting language, texts, and media that showcase the richness and variety of cultures, perspectives, and experiential wealth.

We strive to provide a curriculum that is both meaningful and challenging, and that prepares our students for further education and life in a global society. We want our students to develop a sense of identity and belonging, as well as an appreciation and respect for other cultures and perspectives. We believe that this is the best way to equip our students with the knowledge, skills, and values that they need to thrive in the 21st century.

Our curriculum is designed to align with the national standards and expectations, while also offering opportunities for enrichment and extension beyond the local context. We use a variety of resources and materials from different sources, and we adapt them to suit the needs and interests of our students. We also incorporate elements of inquiry-based learning, project-based learning, and interdisciplinary learning, to foster critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication skills among our students.

One of the challenges of international education is to balance the global and local dimensions of learning. We believe that our students should have a solid foundation in the Ghanaian culture, history, and values, as well as an exposure to the wider world and its diversity. That is why we adopt a Montessori curriculum that integrates the Ghana Education System content with other international curricula, such as the ACE, PACE, International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE).
