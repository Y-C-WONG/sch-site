### 2. Image Optimization

**Implementation Required:**
- Add `alt` attributes to all images
- Implement lazy loading for images below the fold
- Use WebP format with fallbacks
- Optimize image sizes for different viewports

**Example Implementation:**
```html
<img 
  src="/images/hero-school-wider.webp"
  alt="International School campus with students walking between modern buildings"
  loading="lazy"
  width="1200"
  height="600"
  class="w-full h-96 object-cover"
/>
```

### 3. Core Web Vitals Optimization

**Current Issues to Address:**
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Optimize hero images
- First Input Delay (FID): Minimize JavaScript execution
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Set image dimensions

**Recommendations:**
